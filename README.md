# Nmap
Network Mapper Tool
This Network Mapper Tool is a Python-based utility that leverages the Nmap library to perform network scanning tasks. With this tool, you can quickly and efficiently scan networks for open ports and services using three different scanning options: SYN ACK scan, Comprehensive Scan, and UDP scan. This README provides an overview of the tool's features, installation instructions, and future development plans.

Features
1. SYN ACK Scan
The SYN ACK scan is a fast and stealthy scan that sends SYN packets to target ports and waits for SYN ACK responses. It helps identify open ports and services without completing the full three-way TCP handshake.

2. Comprehensive Scan
The Comprehensive Scan option performs an in-depth scan of the target network. It utilizes a variety of Nmap scanning techniques to provide a more thorough analysis of open ports and services.

3. UDP Scan
The UDP scan is designed to identify open UDP ports, which are often used for less common network services. This scan can help you discover potential vulnerabilities in your network.

Future Development
This project is a work in progress, and there are plans to enhance its features in the future. Some of the upcoming improvements include:

User-friendly interface: Implementing a graphical user interface (GUI) to make it more accessible to users who are not familiar with the command line.

Customizable scan profiles: Allowing users to create and save custom scan profiles with specific options and configurations.

Reporting: Generating detailed reports of scan results in various formats, such as HTML or PDF, for easy analysis and sharing.

Integration with other tools: Integrating the tool with other security and network monitoring tools to provide a comprehensive network security solution.

Cross-platform support: Ensuring the tool is compatible with multiple operating systems to cater to a wider user base.

Your contributions and suggestions for improvement are welcome. Feel free to fork the project, create pull requests, or open issues to help make this Network Mapper Tool even better.
